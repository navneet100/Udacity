# First Neural Network
## Introduction
#### In this project, you'll get to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, you'll have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher level tools such as Tensorflow. You'll also get to see how to apply these networks to solve real prediction problems!

#### The data comes from the UCI Machine Learning Database.

## Instructions
#### 1. Download the project materials from our GitHub repository. You can get download the repository with git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning.git. Our files in the GitHub repo are the most up to date, so it's the best place to get the project files.
#### 2. cd into the first-neural-network directory.
#### 3. Download anaconda or miniconda based on the instructions in the Anaconda lesson.
#### 4. Create a new conda environment:
#### 	- conda create --name dlnd python=3
#### 5. Enter your new environment:
#### 		1. Mac/Linux: >> source activate dlnd
#### 		2. Windows: >> activate dlnd
#### 6. Ensure you have numpy, matplotlib, pandas, and jupyter notebook installed by doing the following:
#### 	- conda install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook
#### 7. Run the following to open up the notebook server:
#### 	- jupyter notebook
#### 8. In your browser, open Your_first_neural_network.ipynb
#### 9. Following the instructions in the notebook will lead you through the project.
