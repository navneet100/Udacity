# Face Generation
#### In this project, generative adversarial networks are used to generate new images of faces.

## Data
#### Following two datasets are used in this project:
- MNIST - MNIST dataset contains images of handwritten digits. 
- CelebA - The CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA) dataset contains over 200,000 celebrity images with annotations.

#### Since the celebA dataset is complex and GANs are used in this project, model is first tested on MNIST before CelebA. Running the GANs on MNIST will help in observing the trained model sooner.
