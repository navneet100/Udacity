# Generate TV Scripts
## Introduction
#### In this project, you'll generate your own Simpsons TV scripts using RNNs. You'll be using part of the Simpsons dataset of scripts from 27 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern.

## Getting the project files
#### The project files can be found in our public GitHub repo, in the tv-script-generation folder. You can download the files from there, but it's better to clone the repository to your computer

#### git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning.git
#### This way you can stay up to date with any changes we make by pulling the changes to your local repository with git pull.


## Advanced Projects
#### Need to work on the following extensions of this project:
- Generate your own Bach music using like DeepBach.
