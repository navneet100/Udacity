# Dog Breed Classifier

### Convolutional Neural Networks


#### In this project CNNs are used to classify the image. If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed. If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.

#### Human face detection is done using OpenCV's implementation of Haar feature-based cascade classifiers. This classifier detects human faces with high accuracy of 99%.

#### For Dog breed detection, CNN model and Transfer Learning is used.

#### In Transfer Learning, following pre-trained base models are used:
- VGG19
- Resnet50
- InceptionV3
