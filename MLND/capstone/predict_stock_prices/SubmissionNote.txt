There is one change made in code regarding trickling information from Training to Validation to Testing datasets. Earlier I had first converted data to supervised form using sliding window technique. This resulted in overlap of last set of training data with validation data and last set of validation data was overlapping with first few rows of Testing data. I have change this now to first split the data into Training, Validation and Testing Datasets and then use sliding window technique separately for each dataset separately. I think now information is not leaking from any datasets.
I think I had done this earlier but somehow trying so many models, this code got mixed up. Results are still quite impressive even after this change and better than the Moving Averages and Linear Regression models. As the LSTM results are somewhat close to Moving Averages, it seems that although Moving Averages model capture patterns in past data but LSTM model is better capturing this information.
